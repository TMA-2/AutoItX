# AutoItX
The AutoItX PowerShell module, with added in-line XMLDoc documentation, Markdown, and MAML help.

## ⚠️Disclaimer
*NOTE*: I make no claims to authorship or ownership. The author and owner of AutoItX is [Jonathan Bennett](https://github.com/jonathanbennett73). If you'd like me to remove this, please let me know and I'll comply.

## Purpose / End Goal
My purpose with this is to have an improved experience using the AutoItX module, for which a .chm file does not suffice.
To that end, I've privately decompiled the .NET assemblies (`AutoItX3.Assembly.dll` and `AutoItX3.PowerShell.dll`) with ILSpy in order to add in-line documentation (and to see how they work), with the ultimate goal of generating Markdown and MAML help with PlatyPS.
Then, on completion, seeing if Mr. Bennett is interested in updating the module on the [official AutoIt site](https://www.autoitscript.com) for the community's benefit. A couple examples might also be added, since it currently only contains C++ and VBScript.
